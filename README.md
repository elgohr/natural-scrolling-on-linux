Natural Scrolling On Linux
=============

This script adds natural scrolling to your mouse and/or trackpad on Linux.
Just add the script to your startup routine.

If your devices name doesn't contain "mouse" or "trackpad" (see "xinput list" for this), 
please feel free to edit the regex in the first line.
